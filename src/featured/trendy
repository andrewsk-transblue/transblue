TRENDY landscape

For this project, our clients wanted to maximize their backyard's usability with a fun and inventive design. Their home exterior, although neat, was rather empty. They wanted a large landscape to be the main focal point in their backyard.

It was decided that the large open area would feature a large checkerboard pattern! This design would be eye-catching and fresh, taking their empty space to one perfect for entertaining.

We first installed 60+ square pavers to lay out the pattern.

The empty spaces were then expertly filled by high-quality synthetic grass. Not only does this set-up save our client a lot of cash on water expenses, but it also is great for the environment.  

Finally, we aligned the outside of the large pattern with small trees and shrubs to bring a little natural greenery to the space.

Our client was extremely satisfied with their very unique outdoor living space!
