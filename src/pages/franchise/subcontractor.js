                                    MASTER CONTRACTUAL AGREEMENTThis Master Contractual Agreement is entered into as of ___________________, 2021, and is effective as of that date. This Master Contractual Agreement is entered into between the following parties:CONTRACTOR: ASAD Holdings L.L.C. d.b.a. Transblue Laguna Beach 47 Flintridge Ladera Ranch CA 92694 Phone: (949) 332-0652 Contractor's License No.: 00000000SUBCONTRACTOR: Subcontractor Name Subcontractor’s address City, State Zip Contact phone Contractor's License No.: 000000001. PURPOSE, SCOPE AND APPLICABILITY1.1 The CONTRACTOR and SUBCONTRACTOR identified above enter into this Master Contractual Agreement (“MCA”) with the understanding that it will apply to all future projects for which CONTRACTOR contracts with SUBCONTRACTOR. Each time CONTRACTOR engages SUBCONTRACTOR, a Project Subcontract Agreement (“PSA”) containing project specific terms will be prepared, incorporating the terms of this MCA by reference. This MCA shall be incorporated into every PSA between CONTRACTOR and SUBCONTRACTOR. If there is are conflicts, inconsistencies or ambiguities between this MCA and any PSA, the PSA will control as to the scope and cost of SUBCONTRACTOR’s WORK, as well as any PROJECT specific modifications to the MCA which are listed in the PSA (if any). For any other conflicts or inconsistencies, this MCA shall prevail. However, wherever possible the MCA, PSA shall be construed in harmony, to avoid conflicts.1.2 Although it is desired to have a signed PSA in place before SUBCONTRACTOR supplies materials, provides services or performs work (collectively “WORK”) on any new project (“PROJECT”), the terms of this MCA shall apply to all WORK provided by SUBCONTRACTOR, even if no PSA is signed before WORK is provided.1.3 The plans, specifications, and other design documents (“CONTRACT DOCUMENTS”) for each PROJECT are incorporated by reference into each PSA. SUBCONTRACTOR agrees that its WORK must comply with the CONTRACT DOCUMENTS which CONTRACTOR provides to SUBCONTRACTOR.1.4 The contract between CONTRACTOR and the OWNER related to the PROJECT (the “PRIME CONTRACT”) is on file at the CONTRACTOR’s and is available to be examined by SUBCONTRACTOR. The PRIME CONTRACT is incorporated by reference into the PSA between CONTRACTOR and SUBCONTRACTOR for the PROJECT that the PRIME CONTRACT pertains to. SUBCONTRACTOR agrees to be bound to CONTRACTOR by the terms of the PRIME CONTRACT for the portion of work in the PRIME CONTRACT which SUBCONTRACTOR performs, and to assume toward CONTRACTOR the obligations and responsibilities that CONTRACTOR has to the OWNER. If there are any conflicts between the terms and conditions of the PRIME CONTRACT and either the MCA or the PSA, the MCA and PSA will control.1.5 SUBCONTRACTOR confirms that it (a) has the skill, knowledge, experience and active licensure with the California Contractor’s State License Board (“CSLB”) to permit SUBCONTRACTOR to lawfully perform the work called for in each PSA. If SUBCONTRACTOR utilizes sub-subcontractors for any part of the WORK, such sub-subcontractors must have the skill, knowledge, experience and active CSLB licensure to permit them to perform all WORK they perform. It is SUBCONTRACTOR's obligation to ensure that its licensure and the licensure of its sub-subcontractors fully complies with all CSLB licensing requirements and regulations for the WORK in each PSA before it enters into a PSA for the performance of such WORK.

If the PRIME CONTRACT calls for the use of a different dispute resolution procedure and/or provider, and claims are also asserted between the OWNER and CONTRACTOR related to a PROJECT, then CONTRACTOR and SUBCONTRACTOR agree to the utilization of the dispute resolution procedure and provider provided for in the PRIME CONTRACT, in place of the dispute resolution procedure and provider provided for in the forgoing paragraph. If any litigation or arbitration is pending between the OWNER and CONTRACTOR related to any PROJECT for which SUBCONTRACTOR has supplied materials or performed work or services of any kind, and any claims are asserted in such litigation or arbitration which is alleged to arise out of or relate to any act, omission, materials supplied, or work performed by SUBCONTRACTOR, SUBCONTRACTOR agrees to be joined as a party to such litigation or arbitration, so that all disputes involving a PROJECT may be decided in the same litigation or arbitration.19.3. By signing the space below, CONTRACTOR and SUBCONTRACTOR agree to have all disputes between them decided by binding arbitration, and each understands that they are giving up the following: (1) their right to have disputes litigated in a court of law, (2) their constitutional right to a trial by jury, and (3) their right to appeal any decisions made regarding the dispute. If you refuse to submit to arbitration after agreeing to this provision, you may be compelled to arbitrate under applicable California law.WE HAVE READ, UNDERSTAND AND AGREE TO THE FORGOING.____________________________________ ________________________________ (signature on behalf of SUBCONTRACTOR) (signature on behalf of CONTRACTOR)20. ATTORNEY’S FEES AND LITIGATION COSTS20.1 If CONTRACTOR and SUBCONTRACTOR become involved in litigation or arbitration relating to any claim in law or equity, the prevailing party shall be fully compensated for the costs and expenses associated with its participation in such legal proceedings, including but not limited to, all reasonable attorney's fees, expert fees, court/arbitration expenses and costs of suit. The amount of attorney’s fees awarded shall not be set pursuant to a fixed schedule or computation method, but shall instead provide for the recovery of all attorney's fees, costs and expenses actually and reasonably incurred in conjunction with the dispute between CONTRACTOR and SUBCONTRACTOR. If there is deemed to be a conflict between this clause and any other portion of this MCA or any PSA, or any other document or contract between or binding on the parties to this MCA, this clause shall supersede and take precedence over all other conflicting terms or conditions.21. REQUIREMENTS PERTAINING TO PAYMENT OF THE PERSONNEL OF SUBCONTRACTOR AND ITS SUB-SUBCONTRACTORS.21.1 California Labor Code §218.7 provides terms regarding the obligations for the payment of the personnel of subcontractors. This code contains requirements for subcontractors to provide copies of documentation needed to verify that subcontractor personnel have been paid. If CONTRACTOR believes that personnel of either SUBCONTRACTOR or its sub-subcontractors have not been paid, CONTRACTOR may request information and/or documentation in accordance with Labor Code §218.7. If any such request is made, SUBCONTRACTOR shall be obligated to fully cooperate with CONTRACTOR and provide all statutorily required information and documentation within seven (7) days of CONTRACTOR’s request. Failure of SUBCONTRACTOR to comply with the requirements of this provision shall be deemed to be a material breach of this agreement, and entitle (but not require) CONTRACTOR to immediately terminate all PSAs, this MCA.22. SEVERABILITY22.1 The provisions of this MCA and any PSA are severable, existing separately and apart from one another, and if any part of this MCA or any PSA are found to be unenforceable, the other portions shall remain fully valid and enforceable. This MCA and any PSA shall survive the termination of any paragraph, provision or portion which may be deemed to be void or unenforceable.23. CONTRACT JOINTLY NEGOTIATED23.1 The parties acknowledge and agree that this MCA and each PSA have been entered into in good faith and that each of the parties have signed this MCA and each subsequent PSA after independent investigation and without knowledge of any fraud, duress, or undue influence. Since this MCA, together which each PSA, are intended to be the full and final agreement of the parties, and are intended to supersede and replace all prior discussions, communications, quotations and proposals, whether oral or in writing. This MCA and each PSA shall not be construed as if they had been prepared by one of the parties, but rather as if all parties had prepared them.24. RIGHT TO CONSULTATION24.1 Each party to this MCA and each PSA acknowledge that he/she/they have been given the opportunity to consult with an attorney regarding the provisions of these documents and to obtain the consent of his/her/its attorney to the form and content thereof.25. ASSIGNMENT25.1 SUBCONTRACTOR shall not assign or subcontract any portion of this MCA or any PSA, or any interest therein, and no such assignment shall be binding unless and until accepted by CONTRACTOR, in writing.26. TERMINATION OF THE MASTER CONTRACTUAL AGREEMENT26.1 The MCA shall remain in effect until either party requests, in writing, that the MCA be terminated. Termination shall become effective thirty (30) days after written notice of termination. Termination of this MCA shall not invalidate, reduce or diminish the rights of CONTRACTOR or SUBCONTRACTOR which arose prior to termination, or to seek enforcement of their rights pursuant with the MCA, including but not limited to the right to pursue claims resulting from the breach of any obligation provided for through the MCA. All contractual duties and obligations which existed prior to the termination, including but not limited to, all warranties, insurance obligations, repair obligations, and all defense and indemnity obligations, will survive and remain in effect even after termination of a MCA. Termination of this MCA will not dispose of any of the terms of the MCA, but instead will simply terminate the ability of the parties to utilize the terms of this MCA for any PSA entered into more than thirty (30) days after written notice of termination.26.2 Any notice of termination shall be served by personal delivery, Certified Mail, Federal Express (FedEx), UPS, or such other private mail carrier sufficient to provide verification of the date of providing notice to the other party. If notice is provided by mail carrier, notice shall be sent to the last known address of the other party, and shall be deemed made on the date of deposit with the carrier.27. THE MCA IS NOT A GUARANTEE THAT CONTRACTOR WILL RETAIN SUBCONTRACTOR27.1 Entering into this MCA is not a promise or guarantee that CONTRACTOR will, at any point in time in the future, utilize the services of SUBCONTRACTOR.I AGREE TO THE FORGOING TERMS AND CONDITIONS, AFFIRM THAT I AM AUTHORIZED TO SIGN THIS CONTRACT ON BEHALF OF SUBCONTRACTOR, AND CONFIRM THAT I HAVE OBTAINED ALL NECESSARY APPROVAL TO ENTER INTO AND SIGN THIS CONTRACT, BEFORE SIGNING BELOW.DATE:_____________________ Signature: ____________________________________Name: ____________________________________Title: Authorized signatory for (name of subcontractor)I AGREE TO THE FORGOING TERMS AND CONDITIONS, AFFIRM THAT I AM AUTHORIZED TO SIGN THIS CONTRACT ON BEHALF OF CONTRACTOR, AND CONFIRM THAT I HAVE OBTAINED ALL NECESSARY APPROVAL TO ENTER INTO AND SIGN THIS CONTRACT, BEFORE SIGNING BELOW.DATE:_____________________ Signature: ____________________________________Name: Arman TehraniTitle: Authorized signatory for ASAD Holdings LLC DBA Transblue Laguna Beach
