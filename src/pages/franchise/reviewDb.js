His professionalism was excellent, and if I ever have need for someone to assist with a bigger project I will definitely be contacting Transblue.",

            review: "I needed a deck replacement, badly! It was a pleaure working with Tim Eident, Sales Manager. He was very patient and very responsive to my many iterations until I landed on the final proposal. Shortly after, Khang (Ken) Ta, Project Manager, contacted me to review the plans and discuss the process. Ken also was very professional and courteous, being attentive to my needs and expectations. Ken kept me apprised of the timeline and status of supplies. Once the job started, Jose Aguirre, was the site manager, showed up nice and early as planned. He and his crew were all very polite. My deck isn't that large, but Jose had 4 guys come and boy, they worked very hard! They finished the project in less than 2 days! They cleaned up the patio and hauled away everything.  Now, you know things might go wrong. Ken advised me the suppliers didn't send enough composite as ordered. But to my fortune, they were able to secure the Azek for the risers which put a beautiful finishing touch on the deck. I absolutely LOVE my new deck. It's such a transformation! I love walking on the deck barefoot! My deck is south facing with no trees for shade so I put up, with the crews' help, shade sails. Hands down, a great company to work with! I'll be enjoying my beautiful deck with a lovely bottle a wine Ken gave me. I Love, Love, Love my deck!! Check out my before and after pix.",

There was a delay in starting due to availability of materials, but that's not their fault. There was some slight stress when there was a miscommunication regarding the deck plans and I didn't have an good contact number to get an immediate response, but in short order everything was finished and to my specifications.

During the planning stage, Transblue made sure that they had a very good understanding of our vision for the project and suggested a number of good ideas that we decided to incorporate in the final version. Transblue went to a great deal of effort to match the color and pattern of our existing section of patio, which adds a great deal to the attractiveness of the finished product. Additionally, Transblue installed a section of turf in an area formerly full of weeds and reseeded the areas they had been working on. We were kept informed on a regular basis regarding the status of our project and when we could expect workers to be on site. Overall, we were highly impressed by the quality of their workmanship and their professionalism. We can recommend them highly without reservation.',
