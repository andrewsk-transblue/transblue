We may, in our sole discretion, authorize You to perform Work on certain projects under a Scope of Work (“SOW”). Before authorization, the parties will agree on a contract rate or fixed price sum by Rate Confirmation Sheet substantially in the form of Exhibit A. Each SOW will be substantially in the form of Exhibit B attached hereto and incorporated by reference. We must approve, in writing, all work not included in a SOW or this MSA before you start any such work. Any work not so approved will not be paid for by Us or by the project owner.</p><p>3.\tPayment. You must submit payment applications per the terms of the SOW or within ten</p><p>(10) days of completing the Work if no time period is stated. Within forty-five (45) days after We receive payment for Your Work, and except as otherwise set forth herein, We will pay You per the rates agreed in the applicable SOW.</p><p>3.1\tPaid When Paid. We have no obligation to pay You for any Work performed, or materials or equipment furnished under this MSA or applicable SOW(s) until the project owner pays us the final payment for such Work, materials, or equipment. You expressly agree to bear the risk of project owner’s non-payment. If the project owner pays Us less than the full value of materials delivered to the site, or less than the full value of the Work performed, the amount You will be paid for such materials or Work will be proportionately reduced.</p><p>3.2\tProgress Payments.  All progress payments are considered advances and are subject to adjustment at any time prior to final payment for errors, overpayments, claims, damages, defective work, or to pay lien, retention, or bond claims. No payment constitutes an approval or acceptance of Your Work, the materials furnished, or Your compliance with the MSA or any applicable SOW. If you dispute the amount or timing of any progress payment, You must communicate this to Us, in writing, within fifteen (15) days after Your receipt of the progress payment, or it will be conclusively presumed that such progress payment was accurate and in full accordance with the MSA and all applicable SOWs. Further, You will be barred from making any claim against Us for additional amounts. You will also, promptly and in all cases within two (2) business days after request by Us or the project owner, provide interim lien waivers (on behalf of You and any applicable lower-tier subcontractors) in form and substance acceptable to Us. </p><p>3.3\tOffsets. If You are indebted to Us or anyone else for labor, benefits, taxes, supplies, materials, equipment, or other charges against the Work, We may deduct that amount from payments due and pay such amounts directly to whom You are indebted. We may from time to time require, and You will promptly provide, a written statement setting forth Your debts to third parties for labor, benefits, taxes, supplies, materials, equipment, or other charges against the Work. We may withhold from any payment, progress or final, any amount necessary to secure and protect Us or the project owner from third-party claims or liens for materials or labor related to Your Work. If a third-party files a lien against the Project on account of the Work, We may settle or otherwise resolve the lien claim directly and You will promptly reimburse us for any additional costs we incur.</p><p>3.4\tPayment Conditions. No payment whatsoever, whether progress or final, will be paid to You unless the following conditions precedents are met: (a) We received payment from project owner;</p><p>(b) MSA and any applicable SOW(s) are returned to Us fully executed; (c) You furnish Us with acceptable insurance certificates applicable to the Work evidencing all required coverage and additional insureds named; (d) You affirm that all obligations You incurred pursuant to this MSA and all applicable SOWs that may be the basis for a lien were paid in full; (e) You execute full release and lien waiver on behalf of Yourself and your lower-tier subcontractors and suppliers; (f) You furnish releases and/or certificates from such governmental agencies as may be required; (g) You are in compliance with the project schedule; and</p><p>(h) You are not in material breach of any obligations under the MSA or applicable SOWs.</p><p></p><p>3.5\tFinal Payment. Final payment will be made within forty-five (45) days (or a shorter time period if required by law) if, and only if, the following three conditions are met: (1) project owner accepts the Work; (2) We receive final payment from the project owner; and (3) You provide all required job closeout documents as required by the MSA and all applicable SOWs, including releases and waivers of liens. Your acceptance of final payment constitutes Your release of all claims against Us. You will also, promptly and in all cases within two (2) business days after request by Us or the project owner, provide (on behalf of You and any applicable lower-tier subcontractors) a final lien waiver in form and substance acceptable to Us.</p><p></p><p>4.\tChanges. We may, without invalidating this MSA or applicable SOWs, add, deduct, delete, alter, or change the Work (a “Change Order”).  Change Orders must be in writing and signed by  both parties. You will not commence any extra work or make claims related to extra work unless We have executed a Change Order for that work. Any claim seeking adjustment of the SOW price or time due to a Change Order must be made in writing within forty-eight (48) hours from the Change Order date or the claim is waived. If a Change Order decreases the overall scope of the Work, You expressly acknowledge no claim for lost profits. You also acknowledge that, unless expressly stated otherwise within the Change Order, any change to the SOW by a Change Order constitutes the parties’ full and final agreement concerning all costs incurred, labor performed, materials and equipment furnished, and any delay, acceleration, or loss of efficiency associated with the change in the Work.</p><p></p><p>4.1\tDelays. In the event Your performance of the MSA or any SOW is delayed, extra costs are incurred, or the Work is interfered with, You may request an extension of the time but You will not be entitled to any additional compensation, except to the extent that We may, on behalf of You, recover from project owner for such delays less Our markups or costs. You will accept such recovery, if any, as fully discharging Us with respect to such claims. We are never liable for Your delays if the project owner or a third party caused the delay. You must prepare and present any claim against project owner through Us, and must bear all expenses thereof, including attorneys’ fees. This Section survives termination of the MSA and any SOW.</p><p></p><p>5.\tRepresentations and Warranties. You will furnish all labor, material, tools, equipment, services, supplies, and supervision necessary to complete the Work in a proper and efficient manner per the drawings and specifications, all applicable building codes and all applicable federal, state, county, and city laws, ordinances, statutes, rules, and regulations, particularly those relating to wages, hours, fair employment practices, nondiscrimination, safety and working conditions required by any government authority for the Work.

If there is a prime contract for the Work or Project, You acknowledge that copies of the prime contract are available, have been examined and accepted by You, and that the prime contract is incorporated in this MSA by reference.

Any materials delivered or intended for the project should remain on the job site and are the project owner’s when paid. You may, however, remove any surplus when the Work is completed, unless the prime contract states otherwise. It is Your responsibility to unload, store, secure, and protect the materials, and You bear the risk of loss thereof until the Work is accepted, except You will not bear any loss caused by Us or the project owner.

In such instances, We may terminate you immediately upon written notice or, in the alternative, and because our actual damages are difficult if not prohibitive to calculate, We may charge you liquidated damages of</p><p>$1,000.00 per day for any violation of this provision.</p><p></p><p>8.2\tDefaults with Ability to Cure. The following constitute events of default if not cured within three (3) days of written notice:</p><p></p><p>(a)\tYou refuse or fail to correct or replace faulty or defective work or materials furnished;</p><p>(b)\tYou fail to promptly pay lower-tier subcontractors or material suppliers;</p><p>(c)\tEither You or Your lower-tier subcontractors or suppliers place a lien on the Project;</p><p>(d)\tYou violate the laws, ordinances, rules, regulations, or orders of any public authority having jurisdiction;</p><p> </p><p>(e)\tYou file for bankruptcy protection or are subject to a receivership; </p><p>(f)\tYou fail to provide or obtain, as appropriate, any lien waivers; or</p><p>(g)\tYou commit any other breach of this MSA or any SOW.</p><p></p><p>8.3\tOur Rights Upon Default.

This MSA, and all applicable SOWs will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia, notwithstanding any conflict of law, rule, or principle which might refer such construction to the laws of another state or country.</p><p></p><p>11.\tAssignment.

If the project owner pays Us less than the full value of materials delivered to the site, or less than the full value of the Work performed, the amount You will be paid for such materials or Work will be proportionately reduced.\\n3.2\\tProgress Payments.  All progress payments are considered advances and are subject to adjustment at any time prior to final payment for errors, overpayments, claims, damages, defective work, or to pay lien, retention, or bond claims. No payment constitutes an approval or acceptance of Your Work, the materials furnished, or Your compliance with the MSA or any applicable SOW.

If a Change Order decreases the overall scope of the Work, You expressly acknowledge no claim for lost profits.
